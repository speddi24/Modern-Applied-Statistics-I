Parametric Statistics are used to make inferences about population parameters.
Examples: Regression coefficient,Regression model R-squaed, group means, difference between group means, T-test,chi sqaure test etc.
In all these cases inferences were based on null hypothesis significance testing or confidenc eintervals. 
In all those cases we assumed a perticular sampling distribution. The inferences are valid only when all the assumptions are met.
Sometimes a quick fix is possible to make it valid. sometimes it is not possible for a quick fix and we can use non-parametric methods.

Non-Parametric Statistics do not assume that the data or population have any characteristic structure.
Example: Correlation(spearman's rank correlation coefficient,Kendall's tau),Regression(Non-parametric regression),t-tests(Mann-Whtney U test,Wilcoxan Signed rank test),Anova(Kruskal-wa;;os One-way,Friedman two-way),
chi-square(Mcnemar's test,Fishers exact test).

Semiparametric models are intermediate between parametric and nonparametric models.They are larger than parametric models and smaller than nonparametric models.
One way of applying these methods is via relaxation of one hypothesis in a classical parametric method.
Example: Regression,Partially linear logistic regression.

Various Parametric/semi-parametric and Non-parametric methods were discussed and applied in the files attached in this repository.
